I can ensure that my software is functional and secure by testing early and often. I can incorporate continuous integration and continuous deployment techniques to quickly determine if the code I am building is compatible with the previous sections that were already built, and I can also have my code tested and reviewed by other developers to reduce bias. Regarding user needs, techniques such as interviews and user stories are helpful to translate the functions that users may need or could enjoy into functional requirements. By continuously referring to these requirements while programming, I can ensure that the subsequent program is in alignment with the basis of the end user's expectations. My approach for designing software consists of defining the requirements and specificiations, breaking these requirements into smaller sections for development, and building the code as closely to the requirements as possible with frequent testing and refactoring if needed.
